## `Code/`
`Code/` contains the code I wrote for this project. All code is in python. For each main `.py` file I have write an accompanying Jupyter Notebook with some test code.

|  Description | Python File | Notebook  |
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| Mathematical models  | `Models.py`  | ` Models.ipynb` |
| Approximate Bayesian Computation methods | `ABC.py`  | `ABC.ipynb`  |
| Summary statistic selection methods  | `SummaryStatisticSelection.py`  |  `SummaryStatisticSelection.ipynb` |
